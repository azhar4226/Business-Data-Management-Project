### **Key Insights**  
- Premium models drive revenue, while budget models dominate volume.  
- High-demand products frequently face stock-outs, leading to missed sales opportunities.  
- Seasonal trends (e.g., November peaks) highlight the importance of timely inventory planning.  
- Customers prefer budget-friendly models with 4GB RAM/64GB ROM configurations and blue-colored devices.

### **Recommendations**  
1. Implement demand-driven inventory management to optimize stock levels.  
2. Focus on budget segment models while maintaining a balanced product range.  
3. Prepare for seasonal peaks with advanced stocking and festive promotions.  
4. Adopt a Point of Sale (PoS) system to monitor sales, inventory, and finances efficiently.
